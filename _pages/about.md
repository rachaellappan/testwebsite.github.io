I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Department of Microbiology](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/departments/microbiology) at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, within the [Biomedicine Discovery Institute](https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute). I study the composition and activities of microbial communities, often in extreme environments, to understand how they persist under challenging conditions. My research involves a very nice balance of field work, lab work, bioinformatics, writing and teaching.

I received my PhD in 2018 from [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/) in Perth, where I studied paediatric nasopharyngeal and middle ear microbiomes to identify bacteria protective against recurrent ear infections. It was here that I gained most of my bioinformatics skills through a combination of helpful colleagues and self-directed learning. In 2019, I moved to Melbourne to join the [Greening Lab](greeninglab.com) where I initially worked on the [RISE program](https://www.rise-program.org/). I then worked on a series of environmental microbiology projects exploring how microbes in a range of environments use atmospheric trace gases as a source of energy. I have recently been awarded an [ARC DECRA Fellowship](https://www.arc.gov.au/funding-research/grant-announcement-kits/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-2023): in 2023 I will launch my own research program on microbial life in the atmosphere.

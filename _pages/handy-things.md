Here is a collection of links to tutorials, blogs or other resources that I have found useful in my training, research or career.

# Bioinformatics and coding resources

* Getting started with the command line, or with R? I began with Software Carpentry's [Introduction to Unix](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [Introduction to R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) tutorials
* Dave Tang, a good friend who prompted me to get Twitter and start blogging, has a multitude of helpful bioinformatics bits and pieces on [his blog](https://davetang.org/muse/). If you don't know how to do it, Dave's probably done it and written a post on it.
* Mike Lee's blog, [Happy Belly Bioinformatics](https://astrobiomike.github.io/) (prize for most unique blog title) is also immensely helpful for those starting out in bioinformatics, particularly in microbial ecology.
* A very powerful command called `awk` can help with many tasks I want to accomplish in bash. It's unfortunately also really hard to grasp the syntax. [This tutorial](https://sandbox.bio/tutorials?id=awk-intro) is one I haven't tried, but it looks great!
* If you'd like to make a blog that looks like mine, the [series of blog posts](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/) by Rob Williams are what got me there. The website uses Jekyll, Ruby, HTML and GitHub, none of which I really understand - Rob's guide makes it easy.
* If you loathe the idea of writing a PhD thesis in Microsoft Word, you may wish to consider [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). There's a few thesis templates out there, such as [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) with many versions customised for particular universities.

# Scientific resources

* I really enjoyed Charles Cockell's [astrobiology course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/astrobiology). You can do it for free!
